# UltiCraft Models
UltiCraft Models is a resource pack that aims at subtly improving models with
1. 3D models for many decorative blocks (e.g., workstations)
2. Better stairs
3. Double slabs for polished-type slabs


# Credits

Almost all of the assets have been extracted from UltimaCraft Models packs from GrandMagus. His pack had the best 3d models ever, but was not updated since 1.17, and had many incompatibilities with Vanilla Tweaks and Redstoner-type packs. This packs revives these awesome assets in a cleaned up package for 1.19+
